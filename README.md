# Refresh: Ranking Sentences for Extractive Summarization with Reinforcement Learning

This repository releases codes for our Refresh model. They use Tensorflow 0.10, please use scripts provided by Tensorflow to translate them to newer upgrades.

> Single document summarization is the task of producing a shorter version of a document while preserving its principal information content. In this paper we conceptualize extractive summarization as a sentence ranking task and propose a novel training algorithm which globally optimizes the ROUGE evaluation metric through a reinforcement learning objective. We use our algorithm to train a neural summarization model on the CNN and DailyMail datasets and demonstrate experimentally that it outperforms state-of-the-art extractive and abstractive systems when evaluated automatically and by humans.
